# Uncovering Hidden Customer Segments Through E-commerce Purchase Patterns

## Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies, ultimately leading to improved sales conversion rates and enhanced customer engagement.  The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory visualization, and potentially clustering techniques to segment the customer base.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add other libraries if used, e.g., Scikit-learn for clustering)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries to the console, providing insights into customer purchasing behavior.  Additionally, the analysis will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `customer_segment_plot.png` -  replace with actual filenames if different)  illustrating trends and identified customer segments. These plots will be saved in the project directory.  The specific outputs will depend on the data and the analysis performed.
